Lambdas - An option to anonymous classes
-----

Lambdas are not just syntactical sugar in java. They do few other things as well.

Lambdas functions can be passed to any other fuction just as an arguement.

Java 8 is a big step forward in making the world's most popular language adopt
the functional style of programming. 

To support a functional programming style,

writing a clean functional style code was not possible without the use of an

anonymous inner class boilerplate. With the introduction of Lambda expressions,

functions have become first class citizens and they can be passed around just

like any other variable.

Let's understand this with an example:

Consider an interface with one method notifyMe():

```java
interface Notifier {
	void notifyMe();
}
```

There are 3 ways of providing the implementation:
* **By creating a new class which implements Notifier interface** :
```java
class EmailNotifier implements Notifier{
	@Override
	public void notifyMe() {
		System.out.println("I m in EmailNotifier notifying your for the mails");
	}
}
```
and then call it like this:

```java
Notifier emailNotifier = new EmailNotifier();
emailNotifier.notifyMe();
```
	
* **By creating an anonymous class** -- : The compiler generates a class file for each anonymous inner class and the generated class needs to be loaded and at startup.
```java
Notifier emailNotifierAc = new Notifier() {
	@Override
	public void notifyMe() {
		System.out.println("I m anonymous class and notifying you");
	}
};
```
Let's rewrite the above implementation using lambdas.

* **By using lambdas** In this case, there is no need to define the type or declare a new class here . You can directly pass the function .	

```java
Notifier emailNotifierFi = ()-> System.out.println("I m lambda and notifying you");
emailNotifierFi.notifyMe();
```

lets see how many class files are generated after compilation if all the 3 cases are merged into one class (assuming the class name is DifferenceFinder.java):

</p>

Only one class DifferenceFinder$1.class is generated for case 2 but no inner class is generated for lambda expression because lambdas are implemented differenly in Java 8
than anaonymouse class. Lambda implementation is based on InvokeDynamic instruction, introduced in Java 7.

* What's **InvokeDynamic**?
It's a big topic but so short answer is: to generate code at runtime. The Java developers chose to
 generate the implementation class at runtime. This is done by calling java.lang.invoke.LambdaMetafactory.metafactory

I won't go  in details lets focus on lambdas only.
