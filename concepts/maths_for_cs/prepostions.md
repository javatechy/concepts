# Propositions: 

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.

For example, both of the following statements are propositions. The first is true
and the second is false.
Proposition 1.0.1. 2 + 3 = 5. # true 
Proposition 1.0.2. 1 + 1 = 3  # false

Compound Propositions: 

** NOT, AND, and OR:** 
OR:  So if a mathematician says, “You
may have cake, or you may have ice cream,” he means that you could have both

If you want to exclude the possibility of both having and eating, you should use
“exclusive-or” (XOR):

**IMPLIES **: 

An implication is true exactly when the if-part is false or the then-part is true.

*IFF* :
  	
P Q  (P IFF Q)
T T 		T
T F 		F
F T 		F
F F 		T
