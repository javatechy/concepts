# Propositions: 

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.

For example, both of the following statements are propositions. The first is true
and the second is false.
Proposition 1.0.1. 2 + 3 = 5. # true 
Proposition 1.0.2. 1 + 1 = 3  # false



Compound Propositions: 

** NOT, AND, and OR:** 
OR:  So if a mathematician says, “You
may have cake, or you may have ice cream,” he means that you could have both

If you want to exclude the possibility of both having and eating, you should use
“exclusive-or” (XOR):

**IMPLIES **: 

An implication is true exactly when the if-part is false or the then-part is true.

*IFF* :
  	
P Q  (P IFF Q)
T T 		T
T F 		F
F T 		F
F F 		T

Prime Numbers: 
A prime is an integer
greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11


Predicates :
A predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables.
Most of the propositions above were defined in terms of predicates. For
example
" n is a perfect square”

Quantifiers: alwasy true
There are a couple of assertions commonly made about a predicate: that it is sometimes
true and that it is **always true**.
